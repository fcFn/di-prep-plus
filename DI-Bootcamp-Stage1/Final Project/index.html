              <strong>David Rolfe Graeber</strong> (/ˈɡreɪbər/; February 12,
              1961 – September 2, 2020) was an American anthropologist and
              anarchist activist. His influential work in economic anthropology,
              particularly his books Debt: The First 5,000 Years (2011),
              Bullshit Jobs (2018), and The Dawn of Everything (2021), and his
              leading role in the Occupy movement, earned him recognition as one
              of the foremost anthropologists and left-wing thinkers of his time
              time <em>(source:
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber"
                >Wikipedia</a
              >)</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="hero__about-text">
              For me personally, David Graeber had shown that the world of today
              is not necessarily the best possible world through his activism
              and his published works. His last book,
              <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>, shows that perhaps we have
              misunderstood so many things about humanity's past, present and
              future.
            </p>
            <p class="hero__about-text">
              His other works contain many radical ideas that challenge the
              status quo. To me David Graeber was a true visionary.

                  <em>The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity</em> is
                  published posthumously. The book, co-authored with David
